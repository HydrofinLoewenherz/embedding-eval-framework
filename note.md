- sort node pairs
  - better?
  - what did others do?
- V_{sub} not in math block
- combine 3.1 and 3.2 to one fig with rows
  - or remove one and say it's a representative for sparse graphs
- node2vec
- Weighted Random Sampling: only talk about sampling nodes (note sampling datapoints over in future work)
- Random Walk has no jumps, our version interpolates between structured bfs/dfs and unstructured wrs
- https://cs.stanford.edu/people/jure/pubs/sampling-kdd06.pdf
  - WRS -> BFS/DFS -> RW -> RJ -> my version on-top of RJ
  - commonly used in literature (alpha = 0.15)
- less symbols



- No more RGGs on discs
